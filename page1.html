          <center><h1>Dr. Michael King</h1></center>
          Dr. Michael King along with his wife, Michelle, a dental hygienist and office administrator bring over 25 years of experience in providing comprehensive preventive, restorative, and surgical dental therapy to the Jackson community.  They have two children and a dog:  Madison, Blake, and Darcey.
          <br>
          <br>
Dr. King, a native of Obion county, completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Tennessee at Martin (B.S. Biology) in 1988. He received his Doctor of Dental Surgery from the University of Tennessee College of Dentistry in 1993 graduating with high honors.  After completing a General Practice Residency at the University of Tennessee Memorial Hospital in Knoxville, he moved to Jackson in 1994 to continue his lifelong commitment to the practice of dentistry.
          <br>
          <br>
Dr. King has served his profession by being a member of several dental organizations and holding past  leadership positions including President of the Jackson Study Club, President of the Seventh District Dental Society, President of the Tennessee Academy of General Dentistry, and currently Trustee on the board of the Academy of General Dentistry serving four states, TN, KY, WV, MO.
          <br>
          <br>
In keeping with his passion for lifelong learning and honoring his commitment to provide excellence of care to his patients, Dr. King has accumulated over 1,800 hours of continuing education.  It has earned him an award of Fellowship in the Academy of General Dentistry (FAGD) 2001 and a Mastership in the Academy of General Dentistry (MAGD) 2007. This recognition has been obtained by less than 2% of general dentists!
          <br>
